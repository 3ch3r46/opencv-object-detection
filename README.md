# OpenCV object detection 
 Object detection examples with haar cascade classifier algorithm (Face, eyes, mouth, other objects etc.). Cascade Classifier Training http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/dc/d88/tutorial_traincascade.html

<h3>Haar cascade classifier </h3>
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
